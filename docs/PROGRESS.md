# Extermination Decomp — Progress

Living status document for the Extermination (PS2) decompilation / modding
project. **Keep this current** — update it whenever a milestone is reached, a
finding changes, or the roadmap shifts. It is the entry point for anyone (a
person or an agent) picking up the project.

_Last updated: 2026-05-22_

## Project at a glance

- Goal: a matching decompilation of *Extermination* (PS2, **SCUS-97112**) and,
  long-term, a clean native PC port. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full charter and
  the non-negotiable legal rules.
- Two parallel tracks:
  - **Track A — matching decomp** of the game code. Not started yet.
  - **Track B — asset-format RE / modding tools.** Active. Delivers modding
    value early, before the code is matched.
- Current focus: Track B (asset formats).

## Status

### Done
- **Boot ELF characterized** — `SCUS_971.12`, Metrowerks CodeWarrior, no DWARF
  / no symbols (hardest matching tier). Details in `CLAUDE.md` "Target identity".
- **`DATA.DAT` / `INDEX.IDX` archive** fully reverse-engineered and validated
  (exact tiling). Extractor: `tools/extract_data.py`. 81 regions / 603 files,
  byte-exact, 100% coverage.
- **Asset taxonomy** mapped — 603 files classified by content.
- **SFX** — SShd sound banks decoded to WAV. `tools/decode_sound.py batch`.
  1146 references deduplicated to 241 unique sounds.
- **Dialogue** — `STREAM/VOICE.DAT` decoded: 116 mono clips.
- **Music** — `STREAM/MUSIC.DAT` decoded: 55 stereo tracks (interleaved VAG).

### Open questions / to verify
- **Sample rate.** Streamed audio (VOICE/MUSIC) = **48000 Hz** — strong
  evidence (End Credits matches an official-soundtrack rip's duration). SFX
  bank rate is still unconfirmed (decoded at 22050; may also be 48000).
  Re-confirm both from the decompiled audio engine.
- **Audio clip splitting** is heuristic (silence gaps) — no per-clip index was
  found for `VOICE.DAT` / `MUSIC.DAT`. An index may live in game code/overlays.

### Next steps (roadmap)
- Separate the 55 `MUSIC.DAT` tracks: **25 are the official soundtrack, the
  other 30 are cutscene audio** (per user, cross-referenced with an online
  soundtrack listing). Not yet labelled/split.
- Reverse the **geometry / model** formats (the float-array files in the
  taxonomy — see `docs/FINDINGS.md`).
- Reverse the **texture** format.
- Stand up **Track A**: clone a reference template (`fmil95/recvx-decomp` —
  also CodeWarrior), install objdiff (native arm64), set up splat, build the
  x86_64-Linux `mwccps2` + wibo container, get one leaf function to 100%.

## Repo layout

- `tools/` — original tooling (committed).
  - `extract_data.py` — `DATA.DAT`/`INDEX.IDX` archive extractor.
  - `decode_sound.py` — VAG ADPCM decoder (SFX banks + VOICE/MUSIC streams).
- `docs/` — this folder: project state and findings (committed).
- Disc-derived outputs (`extract/`, `wav/`, `voice/`, `music/`, `iso/`, …) are
  git-ignored — each user regenerates them locally from their own disc.

## Maintaining this folder

- `docs/PROGRESS.md` (this file) — status, open questions, roadmap.
- `docs/FINDINGS.md` — technical reference for reverse-engineered formats.

Update both as work progresses so the next person/agent can continue cleanly.

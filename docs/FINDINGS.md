# Extermination — Reverse-Engineering Findings

Technical reference for formats and facts established so far. The authoritative,
exhaustive format details live in the docstrings of the `tools/` scripts; this
file summarises them and records findings that have no other home.

_Last updated: 2026-05-22_

## Target identity

Pinned in `CLAUDE.md`. In short: **SCUS-97112** (USA), boot ELF `SCUS_971.12`,
compiled with **Metrowerks CodeWarrior** (`mwccps2` 2.3.1.01), **no DWARF and
no symbol table** — blind matching, the hardest tier.

## Disc layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `SYSTEM.CNF` | boot config, names the boot ELF |
| `SCUS_971.12` | boot executable (EE MIPS) |
| `EXTER.BIN` | exactly 1 GiB — **disc padding/dummy** (`"EXTERMINATION"` + `0xAA` filler). Ignore. |
| `EXTER1.DAT` | an MPEG-PS video (FMV) |
| `DATA/DATA.DAT` + `DATA/INDEX.IDX` | the main asset archive (see below) |
| `OVERLAY/AREA*.BIN` | runtime code overlays, `MWo3` (Metrowerks) format, ~19 files |
| `MOVIE/*.PSS` | cutscene FMVs (Sony PSS / MPEG-PS) |
| `STREAM/MUSIC.DAT`, `STREAM/VOICE.DAT` | streamed music and dialogue |
| `IRX/*` | IOP-side modules (mostly stock Sony SDK) |

## `DATA.DAT` / `INDEX.IDX` archive

Two-level container, fully validated by exact tiling. Tool: `tools/extract_data.py`.

- `INDEX.IDX` = N sectors of `0x800`; sector *i* is the descriptor for chunk *i*
  (`{id, off, size, flags, ...}`), plus nested sub-chunk blocks of `0x70` bytes
  at `+0x100`, plus a file-entry table (`[u24 offset, u8 file_id]`).
- Top-level chunks + nested sub-chunks form **81 leaf regions** that tile
  `DATA.DAT` exactly; **603 files** tile every region exactly.
- Full layout: see the `extract_data.py` module docstring.

### Asset taxonomy

`file_id` is an **asset-role tag**, not a format tag — content varies by region.
Observed content types: SShd sound banks, float-array geometry/model data,
`07 XX 00 60` GS texture packets, ASCII text (`id 0x80`), tables/padding. A
region bundles one logical entity's pieces (geometry + textures + audio).

## Textures

Textures are PS2 **GS texture-upload packets** in `DATA.DAT` — 28 of them, each
a file beginning `07 XX 00 60`. Tool: `tools/extract_textures.py`.

- The packet is GIF/DMA data: GS register writes (`BITBLTBUF` 0x50, `TRXPOS`
  0x51, `TRXREG` 0x52, `TRXDIR` 0x53) then an IMAGE-mode GIF tag with the payload.
- `TRXREG` gives the transfer region `w x h` in PSMCT32 (32-bit). The real
  texture is **8-bit indexed (PSMT8)**, dimensions `(w*2) x (h*2)` — the
  PSMCT32-page / PSMT8-page footprint ratio is 2x per axis.
- The index data is in PS2 **swizzled** VRAM order. The tool recovers it with
  the documented GS pipeline — write the PSMCT32 transfer into simulated VRAM,
  read it back as PSMT8, using the hardware page/block/column swizzle tables.
  This was verified **byte-identical** to the standard combined `unswizzle8`,
  so the swizzle is provably correct. Results are 512-wide sheets.
- The extractor also finds packets **embedded** in larger `id 0x44` level
  files (57 packets total, vs 28 standalone). A few embedded results look
  noisy — likely false-positive signature matches.
- **Color source is unresolved.** The format is 8-bit (PSMT8), which on GS
  hardware always samples through a CLUT — so a CLUT exists in VRAM at
  runtime. But no CLUT data was found in `DATA.DAT` or the boot ELF, and a
  smoothness test (adjacent-pixel delta ~7-22, vs ~85 for a random palette)
  shows the 8-bit values are luminance-ordered. So either the runtime CLUT is
  a grayscale ramp (color then comes from renderer vertex-color modulation)
  or there is a luminance-sorted color CLUT not yet located. The `TEX0` setup
  in the decompiled draw code will settle it. The grayscale PNG output is
  faithful to the index data either way.
- Each decoded sheet is a texture **atlas** — many individual textures packed
  into one sheet, some stored flipped/rotated to pack tighter, plus
  non-texture padding. The swizzle is correct (proven above); the sheet just
  *is* a packed atlas. Cutting it into clean, correctly-oriented individual
  textures needs each texture's UV rectangle from the geometry/draw data.

## Audio — VAG ADPCM

All game audio is **PS2 VAG ADPCM** (16-byte frames). Decoder: `tools/decode_sound.py`.

- **SFX**: `SShd` sound-bank containers inside `DATA.DAT` files. A bank holds
  many sounds; each ends on a VAG flag with bit 0 set. `decode_sound.py batch`
  deduplicates across banks → 241 unique sounds.
- **`VOICE.DAT`**: one raw **mono** VAG stream, no container, no end-flags.
  Split into clips on silence gaps. → 116 clips.
- **`MUSIC.DAT`**: one raw **interleaved-stereo** VAG stream — alternating
  **64-frame (1024-byte) L/R blocks**. Deinterleave then decode.
  `decode_sound.py stream --interleave 64`. → 55 stereo tracks.

### Sample rate

Streamed audio plays at **48000 Hz** (PS2 SPU2 native rate). Evidence:
`music/clip_0000` (End Credits) matches an official-soundtrack rip — the rip is
encoded at 48000 Hz, and our clip's frame count / the rip's duration ≈ 48090 Hz.
The rate is **not stored in the audio data** (engine/SPU-pitch parameter).
SFX-bank rate is still unconfirmed (provisionally 22050). Both should be
re-confirmed from the decompiled audio engine.

## Geometry / models

**Level geometry decoded; character/object models still pending.** Exporter:
`tools/extract_models.py` (geometry file → Wavefront OBJ). Full format details
are in that script's module docstring; summary below.

The `id 0x44` **level** files are decoded and validated — all 32 export to
valid OBJ. **But the MESH-descriptor signature also appears in ~330 other
files** across many file ids — almost certainly the character / enemy / prop
/ object models. `extract_models.py` does *not* yet decode those: tested on
non-`id 0x44` files it extracts nothing or near-nothing (e.g. an `id 0x70`
file gave 734 vertices but only 8 faces), so they use format variant(s) still
to be reverse-engineered.

3D geometry in the `id 0x44` level files is a sequence of **variable-length
blocks**, not a flat vertex array (the earlier "uniform 64-byte record run"
reading was a coincidence of the first block).

**Block structure.** Blocks are delimited by a 16-byte separator row
`00 00 00 17` + twelve `00`. Each separator is followed by a 16-byte
*descriptor* row naming the block kind (block 0 has no leading separator):

- **MESH** — descriptor ends `04 04 00 01 00 80 80 6c`. Geometry starts right
  after the descriptor.
- **SUBMESH** — descriptor `0X 00 00 00 .. .. .. .. 4d 04 00 00 ..`: a mesh
  with an extra ~0x40-byte sub-header (an index, a vertex count, a bounding
  box). The MESH descriptor reappears inside the block; geometry follows it.
- **MATRIX** — `ff ff ff ff` at descriptor+0x04: a scene-graph / instance
  4x4-transform table, *not* geometry. Skipped.
- **FILLER** — all-`0xff` descriptor: padding. Skipped.

**Vertex record — 64 bytes, four 16-byte rows:**

| Offset | Contents |
|---|---|
| `+0x00` | marker: `<u32 m0> <u32 m1>` + 8 zero bytes. m0/m1 are constant within one strip (a per-strip key). **Byte 7 is the strip flag**: `0x00` for a strip's 2 priming vertices, `0x20` for continuation vertices. |
| `+0x10` | vec4 `(u, v, 1.0, 0.0)` — texture coordinates |
| `+0x20` | vec4 — either a **unit normal** `(nx,ny,nz,0)` (dynamic meshes) or a **vertex color** `(r,g,b,1)` with components 0..1 (static/world meshes with baked lighting). Distinguished per-vertex by `|xyz|≈1`. |
| `+0x30` | vec4 world-space **position** `(x, y, z, w)`, `w ≈ ±1.0` |

A real vertex always has `|w| ≈ 1.0`; header/padding rows that share the
64-byte grid do not — this is the reliable validity test.

**Topology — triangle strips.** Consecutive valid vertices form strips; a new
strip begins at a flag-`0x00` vertex following a non-`0x00` one (the
`00 00 20 20 …` priming pattern). N strip vertices → N−2 triangles with
alternating winding. **Degenerate (zero-area) triangles** are the PS2 idiom
for stitching strips into one draw call and are dropped on export.

**Validation.** On `chunk04.n0/f06_id44.bin`: 19271 non-degenerate triangles,
zero degenerate or level-spanning faces, coherent bounding box
(≈ 455 × 162 × 1813 units), unit normals. All 32 geometry-bearing `id 0x44`
files export to valid OBJ (4 `id44` files hold non-geometry data).

**Still uncertain.** Material/texture binding: m0/m1 are constant per strip
and clearly key a material or texture page, but the mapping to the GS texture
packets is not decoded — the exporter groups strips into OBJ objects by
(m0, m1) to preserve the grouping. The SUBMESH sub-header fields and the
MATRIX instance transforms are not applied (geometry is exported in stored
object space).

## `MUSIC.DAT` track listing

`MUSIC.DAT` decodes to 55 tracks. Per the user (cross-referenced with an online
soundtrack listing): **25 are the official soundtrack; the remaining 30 are
cutscene audio.** Not yet separated or labelled — a roadmap item.
